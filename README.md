Decisions:
I used chatGPT to create the web-interface for the quiz.
Creating a prompt for the system_message, used simple language and tried to be as specific as possible.
Implemented adaptive difficulty using assistant prompts to generate easier/harder questions.

Challenges:
The successive questions were repeated.
  Appended system_message with the countries already covered and prompted to not generate them
Reloading site starts with where the last session ended.
  Need to understand how to delete the cookies once the window is closed.
I am not very good at HTML and web design.
  Used chatGPT for this assignment.
